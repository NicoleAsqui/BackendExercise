## Entity Relationship Diagram

After understanding the business rules, one of the next steps for the design of a backend application is the design of the data structure that will contain the persistent information of the system. In this case it has been decided to use a relational database. You can see the Entity Relationship Diagram below.

You can also refer to the Hand-on Database ERD video, which explains the making of this diagram.

## App structure

```Txt
ðŸ“¦backend
 â”£ ðŸ“‚app                          This folder contains the application logic and is divided into subfolders based on responsibilities.
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚entities                   Contains the domain entities of the application.
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚interfaces                 Defines the interfaces that connect the application layer with external layers.
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚controllers              Contains controllers that handle application requests and responses.
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚gateways                 Defines interfaces to interact with the infrastructure layer from the application layer.
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚presenters               Transforms data from the application layer into a suitable format for the presentation layer.
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚tests                      Contains files and logic related to application testing.
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚usecases                   Contains the use cases or main functionalities of the application.

 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚repositories               Implements the repositories defined in the application layer.
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚services                   Implements external services or integrations with external APIs.
 â”£ ðŸ“‚interfaces                   Defines the user interfaces of the application.
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚api                        Represents the application programming interface (API) of the application.
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚controllers              Contains controllers specific to the API.
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚docs                     Contains documentation related to the API.
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚error_handling           Contains files and logic related to error handling in the API.
